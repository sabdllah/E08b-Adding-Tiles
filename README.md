In this excersice, I opened a scene in Godot and added five rows of tiles that wear meant to be an obstacle that the ball can break through. I moved the tiles so that they appear as a brick wall that the ball must breakn through. The ball moves automatically however it stays on the screen by bouncing off the paddle created in the previous excersice. When the ball falls off the screen, the game appears to be over. I saved the scene and committed it to GitHub.
